[Ardublock v3 - Block coding program for Arduino and ESP](www.ardublock.ru/3)

by Vitaly Petrov

The ArduBlock project is an innovative block programming language specifically designed to quickly and easily create programs on the Arduino and ESP platforms. Each block has a unique feature - it contains a piece of C++ code, but is signed in your native language. This allows developers from all over the world, even those who do not have deep programming knowledge, to create programs for their DIY projects easily and without problems.
